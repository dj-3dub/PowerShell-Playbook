## 🆕 What's new

- Export-ADObjects-NoRSAT: added a lightweight mock mode to `scripts/Export-ADObjects-NoRSAT.ps1` for offline testing and CI usage.

  - Flag: `-Mock` (simulate AD objects without RSAT or network connectivity)
  - Use `-MockCount` to control how many objects are generated (default: 25)
  - Output is written to the path supplied to `-OutputPath` (creates directory if needed)

  Example (generate 50 mock users to exports/users_mock.csv):

```powershell
.\scripts\Export-ADObjects-NoRSAT.ps1 -ObjectType User -Mock -MockCount 50 -OutputPath .\exports\users_mock.csv -Verbose
```

  This mode is useful for demonstrations, CI pipelines, or when RSAT/System.DirectoryServices is not available.

### 🧪 VMware Windows Server Deploy (no vCenter required)

Design and present a full VMware build plan (clone → sizing → 4 NIC attach → 2× NIC Teams → IP config) without touching a real environment.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\dev\Invoke-WinServerVmBuild-Mock.ps1 `
  -VMName "WIN-SQL01" -Template "Win2022-Core-Golden" `
  -Datacenter "DC1" -Cluster "Prod-Cluster01" -Datastore "iSCSI-DS1" `
  -CPU 8 -MemoryGB 32 -DiskGB 200 `
  -PortGroup1 "Prod-LAN-A" -PortGroup2 "Prod-LAN-B" -PortGroup3 "Prod-LAN-A" -PortGroup4 "Prod-LAN-B" `
  -Hostname "WIN-SQL01" -IPv4 "10.20.30.40" -PrefixLength 24 -Gateway "10.20.30.1" `
  -DnsServers "10.20.30.10","1.1.1.1" `
  -OutputPath .\out
```

## 🧩 Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 **or** PowerShell 7+
- Windows Server for role/feature inventory
- Admin rights for some functions (Defender, SupportBundle)

### Optional provider modules

The Extensions module integrates with several cloud and vendor provider modules which are optional but enable additional features:

- Az (Azure) — install `Az.Accounts` and related Az modules to enable `Get-CloudBaseline` and Azure queries.
- Microsoft Graph — install `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` (or the Microsoft.Graph metapackage) to enable Graph-based checks.
- Exchange Online — install `ExchangeOnlineManagement` for Exchange tenant health reports.
- AWS — install `AWSPowerShell.NetCore` to enable AWS-specific baselines.
- VMware — install `VCF.PowerCLI` (recommended) to enable hypervisor reporting. If you previously had older `VMware.*` modules installed, remove them first to avoid publisher/signature conflicts.

Example (CurrentUser scope):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts,Microsoft.Graph.Authentication,ExchangeOnlineManagement,AWSPowerShell.NetCore,VCF.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber
```

If you can't or don't want to install all providers, the module will still import and most functions will return warnings or no-ops when a provider is missing.

### Antivirus / Windows Defender

Some vendor SDK files (for example VMware SDK scripts) may be flagged by antivirus products during module installation or import. If you see "This script contains malicious content and has been blocked by your antivirus software" for paths under your user modules folder, whitelist the PowerShell modules location (example path):

`C:\Users\<you>\Documents\PowerShell\Modules`

Whitelisting that folder or temporarily disabling AV during module install will avoid blocked files. Prefer to re-enable AV and only whitelist trusted module folders.

### Removing old VMware modules

If you encounter publisher or signature conflicts when installing `VCF.PowerCLI`, remove older `VMware.*` modules first. A helper script is included:

```powershell
# Run from the repo root (this attempts to uninstall user-scoped VMware modules)
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\cleanup-vmware-modules.ps1
```

If the script reports leftovers in `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\Modules` you will need to remove those folders with admin rights (or run the removal in an elevated session).
